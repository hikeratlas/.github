# Hiker Atlas

Hiker Atlas is a hobby project by [Colin Dellow](https://cldellow.com).

The goal is to produce an open-source hiking website and mobile app, built on OpenStreetMap data. I'm trying to optimize for minimum ops overhead, both in terms of cost and in terms of effort. To that end, I plan to lean into serverless things like Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare D1, and PMTiles hosted on Cloudflare R2.

I'm mainly interested in scratching my own itches -- multi-day backcountry hiking trips in North America. Feedback on how to make it more generally useful is welcome, too.
